							<p>this was something which looked at how multiverse analysis played with synthetic data. with only using a single dataset, the outcomes were bad. the overall conclusion

									and you want to have an open dataset. you take the original dataset, simulate some fake data with the <i>synthpop</i> package,
									and inject it into the original dataset.<br></p>
